# pixlabel

A simple web-tool for labeling images and extracting image pixel information. Pixlabel allows users to define custom labels and colors to annotate the image and collect pixel level information. The collected red, green, and blue channels from the selected pixels can be downloaded in a traditional spreadsheet and then used in linear and non linear models.
